I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Northwestern University. I received my PhD in Economics from MIT in 2023.

My research studies development and labor economics, with a particular interest in labor markets in developing countries, market power, and the role of social protection in improving the lives of the poor.

[The Effects of Mandated Maternity Leave on Labor Market Outcomes in India](#) (with Pulak Ghosh, Stephanie Hao, Lisa Ho, and Shreya Tandon). September 2025. [Email for draft](mailto:garima.sharma@northwestern.edu)<br>

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
This paper studies the effects of a 2017 Indian law that increased the duration of paid maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks on the labor market outcomes of women and men: wages, employment, and career trajectories. Leveraging pre-reform variation in the duration of leave offered across employers (driven by parent company policies), and linking social security records covering the universe of formal workers in India with all LinkedIn profiles, we document four main findings. First, the policy reduced female employment by 6% within six months of implementation and by 10% within four years. These effects were concentrated among young women aged 18 to 35, with no impact on men or older women, indicating that the average firm shrank in response to higher costs. Second, employers did not pass costs onto wages: women’s wages remained unchanged while men’s wages rose slightly, consistent with firms seeking to retain experienced male employees as women became more expensive to employ. Third, men were promoted over women: incumbent male workers were more likely to move into managerial and abstract roles requiring higher firm-specific human capital, while young women were more likely to be placed in manual or routine positions. Fourth, to rationalize the magnitude of the employment decline, employers would have to greatly overestimate the rate at which women take maternity leave (implying employer misperceptions). First estimates suggest the mandate was welfare-neutral: it benefited employed women while raising costs for employers.
